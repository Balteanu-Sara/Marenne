        In the last decade, independent publishing rapidly grew, with many
        emerging publishers utilising new technologies and the ability to
        produce books on small scales and at low costs. Marenne Books was
        realised as a distribution platform against this background, initiated
        to support the large growth of these emerging publishers, who at the
        time had limited means to distribute their work using traditional models
        of book distribution. Marenne Books began by working with publishers Aki
        Books, Hassla, Nieves, Seems and The Institute of Social Hypocrisy,
        introducing retailers to publications that had, until then, rarely been
        available in Europe. Marenne Books now represents publishers from the
        UK, Europe, USA and Japan and distributes to a wide selection of
        bookshops and specialist retailers worldwide.
